== Running with Rake

The easiest way to run the unit tests is through Rake. The default task runs
the entire test suite for all classes. For more information, check out the
full array of rake tasks with "rake -T".

Rake can be found at http://rake.rubyforge.org.

== Running by hand

To run a single test suite

   rake test TEST=path/to/test.rb

which can be further narrowed down to one test:

   rake test TEST=path/to/test.rb TESTOPTS="--name=test_something"
