Description: MVC ruby based framework geared for web application development
 Rails is a full-stack, open-source web framework in Ruby for writing
 real-world applications.
 .
 Being a full-stack framework means that all layers are built to work
 seamlessly together. That way you don't repeat yourself and you can
 use a single language from top to bottom. Everything from templates to
 control flow to business logic is written in Ruby.
