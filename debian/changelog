rails-4.0 (4.0.0+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Antonio Terceiro ]
  * Migrate to use dh_ruby multi-binary support

  [ Ondřej Surý ]
  * New upstream version 4.0.0+dfsg
  * Update the package based on ftp-master review:
    + Weaken some Conflicts to Breaks (Keeping Conflicts for virtual
      packages)
    + Generate actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/journey/parser.rb in the
      build using racc
    + Fix copyright to include correct year: (c) 2004-2013 David
      Heinemeier Hansson
    + Add MIT and/or CC-BY license for HTML selector by Assaf Arkin  
    + PD-Art license is inconclusive, so we just remove the wikimedia Mona
      Lisa picture and patch out the tests that were using it.
      (http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Reuse_of_PD-Art_photographs)
    + Just remove whole guides.rubyonrails.org content from source tarball
      (We'll repackage it to ruby-rails-guides-4.0 as soon as we clear the
      licensing with upstream.)
    + MIT-LICENSE in templates is needed for templating new projects, add
      a lintian-override
  * Add dversionmangle to debian/watch
