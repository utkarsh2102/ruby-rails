rails (2.3.14) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting from 2.3.14, the rails package starts to depend on rails
  packages packaged from separate sources ending with -2.3.  This
  will allow rails 3.x to enter the archive in the future.
  
  Unfortunately this may break some existing applications.  Namely
  the symlink(s) in <app_dir>/vendor/rails will point to nonexistent
  directory.  You can fix that by running:
  
      ln -sf /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/rails vendor/rails
  
  in the application directory.
